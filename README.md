Hello from MTRX!

MTRX is an Image Editing web tool that allows you to upload an image and play around with
convolution matrices/kernels to see what effect they have on your Image.

You can use these 3x3 matrices to sharpen images, find an image's outlines, blur an image,
and so on and so forth.

You can visit the tool at http://mtrxio.herokuapp.com to see it in action. Be aware of the fact that
if your image is larger than 200kb, the server might give you a timeout.

Here are the instructions for cloning and running this software on your own computer.

1. Clone this repo into a local directory
2. This is a python app, so you will need to have python installed
3. Run pip3 install flask
4. Run "Flask run" or "python3 app.py" in the directory with the app.py file
5. After that, you should be able to copy the localhost URL from the terminal and see
the web app in action

Feel free to contact me if there are any issues, and this project will continue evolving into a more sophisticated image editing tool.
